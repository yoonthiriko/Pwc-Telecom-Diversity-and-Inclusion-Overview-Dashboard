# Pwc-Telecom-Diversity-and-Inclusion-Overview-Dashboard

This repository contains the **Gender Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard**, a Power BI project created to support the Human Resources team of a telecom client. This dashboard aims to provide actionable insights into gender balance at the executive management level and highlight key metrics related to hiring, promotions, performance, and turnover. It was developed as part of a simulation project with PwC.

## Project Overview

### **Background**
Human Resources at the telecom company have been striving to improve gender diversity at the executive level. Despite their efforts, progress has been slow. They approached PwC Switzerland for assistance, seeking support in understanding and addressing the challenges associated with diversity and inclusion.  

At PwC, we view diversity and inclusion as business imperatives, not just "nice-to-haves." This project focuses on using data analytics to uncover root causes of slow progress and identify practical KPIs that help drive a more inclusive culture.
